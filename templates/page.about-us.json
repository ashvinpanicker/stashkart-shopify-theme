Avani, his school friend and a designer, had notebooks full of illustrations waiting for a canvas. What started as “let’s make a store” soon grew into a platform where creators, artists, and brands can transform their ideas into products, without inventory, risk, or design skills. Today, Stashkart empowers anyone with an idea to productize it, seamlessly and creatively.</p>"
